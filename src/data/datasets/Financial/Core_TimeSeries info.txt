This dataset contains 30,000 rows of synthetic but highly realistic financial time-series data representing approximately 15 years of trading days. Each row corresponds to a single business day and includes key variables used in real financial modeling, such as open and close prices, trading volume, daily percent returns, and intraday volatility.

In addition to core trading features, this dataset includes widely-used technical indicators such as the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA-20), 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA-50), and the popular Relative Strength Index (RSI-14). These indicators enable advanced quantitative analysis and machine-learning workflows such as regression forecasting, classification of market movement, algorithmic trading simulations, and trend modeling.

This dataset is ideal for:

Stock price prediction
Trend and volatility modeling
Time-series machine learning (LSTM, Prophet, ARIMA, Transformers)
Quantitative finance teaching and learning
Algorithmic trading strategy development
Market simulation and risk analysis

All values are simulated using realistic market distributions and stochastic processes to closely resemble authentic stock data. The dataset is fully synthetic and safe for public use.
